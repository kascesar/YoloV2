# Own implementation Yolo V2 in TnesorFlow 2
This proyect contains an implementation of Yolo V2 [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242) in TnesorFlow.

For now the proyect only contains a class for loss and for building the model. 

# TODO

1. make an explanation about the model
2. notebook show how to build, and train
3. build a SEYoloV2 (sqeeze and exitation model)
